# This sample script changes two previous project home page URL styles
# on http://pear.horde.org/.  A simple sed replacement doesn't work in this
# case because the macros need to be expanded in order to lower-case the
# project name. This script uses rpmspec to expand the macros before
# lower-casing it and replacing the original URL.
#
# If the file "list" contains a list of spec files, one per line, run the
# script on them like this:
#   xargs -n1 change-parsed-url < list

# Abort in case of error
