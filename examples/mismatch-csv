# This sample script takes the output of spec-rpm-mismatch but outputs in CSV
# form only the packages where the spec & RPM versions do not match. This shows
# how to mechanically process the XHTML output and transform it to obtain
# useful information.
#
# Usage:
#   spec-rpm-mismatch | mismatch-csv
# or:
#   mismatch-csv report.html
